# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy will explain how our organization uses data we collect from you when
you visit our website, or when use our application.

## What data do we collect?

We track visits on our main website (repath.studio) using a privacy-aware web analytics
platform that doesn’t track users with unique identifiers. The following information is
stored in this way:

- Browsers, based on headers sent by the browser (e.g. Firefox 139, Chrome 102)
- Systems, based on headers sent by the browser (e.g. Windows 11, macOS 15.2).
- Country (e.g. Indonesia, Canada).
- Languages (e.g. English, Klingon).
- Screen size (e.g. 768, 1920).

We may also send anonymous error reports when you use the application. Typically, an error
report may contain the following:

- The error message that occurred.
- Information about the use of the app immediately before the incident and when the app
  was started.
- Date and time of the incident.
- Device information: operating system and version, app version and device model.
- Status of the device: battery charge and temperature, charging state, boot time, memory
  space and connection type (Wi-Fi/mobile data), (free) storage space, preferred language,
  device orientation, screen resolution and density, time zone.

## How do we collect your data?

Web visits are stored when you visit the main website. Errors are automatically reported
when something goes wrong while using the application. When you use the application for
the first time, you will be notified about this and you will have the option to enable or
disable error reports. We also offer the ability to change this option at any time.

## How will we use your data?

Error reports and web visits are used for the sole purpose of identifying and fixing
potential issues. We will not share, sell, rent, disclose, trade, publish or in any other
way make data available to a third party unless it is required in order to deliver the
service, or unless it is required by law or in order to fulfil a legal obligation.

## How do we store your data?

We do not store any data directly. GoatCounter's analytics data is stored on servers at
Hetzner Online GmbH in Finland and Germany. Sentry's error reports are also stored in the
EU. For more information, see [Sentry's Data Storage Location](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/data-storage-location/).

## How can you access or delete this data?

Since we try to anonymize reported data as much as possible, there is no reliable way to
find your data.

Pageviews and all associated data will be permanently removed after 90 days. Error events
will also be automatically deleted after 90 days. For more information, see
[Sentry's Data Retention Periods](https://docs.sentry.io/security-legal-pii/security/data-retention-periods/).
